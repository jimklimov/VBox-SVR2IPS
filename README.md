VBox-SVR2IPS
============

Purpose
========

The goal of these scripts is to allow the conversion from SVR package provided by VirtualBox to be stored into an IPS
repository, allowing the sysadmin to easily push the packages to a set of machines.

Also, you can package the extension pack into an IPS package that will take care of installing that extension pack
on the currently used VirtualBox.

Usage
======

TBD

Supported Platforms
====================

This script was first developped for OpenIndiana, but the latest release has only been tested on Solaris 11.1.
